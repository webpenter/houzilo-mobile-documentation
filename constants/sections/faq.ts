## Backend & Infrastructure

### Is a backend included with this purchase?

**What's Included:**
- ✅ BookHere-Homey Connector Plugin (bridges app with Homey theme)
- ✅ Mobile-optimized REST API endpoints
- ✅ Easy installation & configuration guide
- ✅ Saves you 40-80 hours of custom API development!

**What's NOT Included (Must Purchase Separately):**
- ❌ Homey WordPress Theme (~$59-79 from ThemeForest)
  - This provides the actual backend (property management, bookings, etc.)
  - Our plugin connects your mobile app to it

### What backend do I need?

**You need two things:**

1. **Homey WordPress Theme** (Purchase separately)
   - Cost: ~$59-79 on ThemeForest
   - Search "Homey" on ThemeForest.net
   - Provides complete property rental backend functionality

2. **WordPress Installation** (Free)
   - WordPress 6.0+ from WordPress.org
   - Web hosting with PHP & MySQL ($5-20/month)

**Our Included Connector Plugin:**
- Bridges mobile app with Homey theme
- Provides mobile-optimized API endpoints
- Handles authentication, data sync, push notifications
- Easy to install and configure

### Do I need to buy the Homey theme?

**YES!** ✅ Homey theme is required for the backend.

**Why Homey Theme is Needed:**
- Provides the property management system
- Handles bookings and reservations
- Manages payments and transactions
- Includes admin dashboard for hosts
- Search and filtering system
- User management

**What Our Included Plugin Does:**
- Connects your mobile app to Homey

**Total Cost:**
- BookHere package: (your purchase)
- Homey theme: ~$59-79 (one-time)
- Web hosting: $5-20/month

### What exactly is the BookHere API Plugin?

**Technical Features:**

2. Upload our API plugin: 2 minutes
3. Activate & configure: 15 minutes
4. Connect mobile app: 5 minutes

**Total: 30-45 minutes** ✅

Compare this to building a custom backend: 40-80 hours!

### What hosting do I need?

Any standard WordPress hosting works! No special requirements.

**Recommended Hosting Providers:**
- **Shared Hosting** ($5-15/month): SiteGround, Bluehost, HostGator
  - Perfect for starting out
  - Handles 1,000-10,000 users easily

- **Managed WordPress** ($20-50/month): WP Engine, Kinsta, Flywheel
  - Better performance
  - Automatic backups & updates

- **VPS** ($20-50/month): DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr
  - More control
  - Better for scaling

- **Cloud** ($10-100/month): AWS, Google Cloud, Azure
  - Maximum scalability
  - Pay for what you use

**For most users:** Start with shared hosting ($5-15/month). Upgrade later if needed.

### What's the total cost to get started?

**Complete breakdown:**

**One-time costs:**
- BookHere package (mobile app + connector plugin): (your purchase) ✅
- **Homey WordPress theme: $59-79** (required - purchase from ThemeForest)
- Domain name: $10-15/year (optional)
- SSL certificate: FREE (Let's Encrypt) ✅

**Monthly costs:**
- Web hosting: $5-20/month (shared hosting works fine)
- Transaction fees: 2.9% + $0.30 per booking (Stripe, when you start earning)

**Total first year:** Your purchase + $59-79 (theme) + $60-240 (hosting) = ~$119-319 total

**What You Save:**
- ✅ 40-80 hours of custom API development (would cost $2,000-4,000!)
- ✅ Mobile app development (would cost $8,000-15,000!)
- ✅ Our connector plugin makes integration seamless

**Compared to building from scratch:** You save $10,000-19,000!

### Can I use my existing WordPress website?

**Yes!** Absolutely!

If you already have a WordPress website:
1. Simply install our API plugin
2. Configure the plugin settings
3. Connect the mobile app
4. Your existing website continues working normally

The API plugin doesn't interfere with your website. It just adds API endpoints for the mobile app.

### What if I already have a property rental website (non-WordPress)?

You have options:

**Option 1: Use our WordPress plugin (Easiest)**
- Set up WordPress on a subdomain (e.g., api.yoursite.com)
- Install our plugin
- Mobile app connects to this subdomain
- Your main website stays unchanged

**Option 2: Build custom integration (Advanced)**
- Modify the mobile app to work with your existing API
- Requires development skills
- API documentation provided

**Option 3: Hybrid approach**
- Use our WordPress backend for mobile app
- Keep your existing website for web users
- Sync data between both (requires custom integration)

### Do I need technical skills to set up the backend?

**No! Basic WordPress knowledge is enough.**

If you can:
- ✅ Install WordPress (or use 1-click installer)
- ✅ Upload a plugin via WordPress admin
- ✅ Fill out a settings form
- ✅ Copy-paste a URL

Then you can set up the backend! 🎉

**We provide:**
- Step-by-step installation guide with screenshots
- Configuration wizard in the plugin
- Video tutorial (coming soon)
- Email support if you get stuck

### Can I test the app without setting up hosting?

**Demo Options:**

1. **Use local WordPress** (Fastest for testing)
   - Install XAMPP or MAMP on your computer (free)
   - Run WordPress locally
   - Install our plugin
   - Test app connecting to localhost
   - Takes 30 minutes to set up

2. **Use free hosting temporarily**
   - 000webhost.com, InfinityFree (free tier)
   - Install WordPress + our plugin
   - Test before buying paid hosting

3. **Request demo access**
   - Email support@webpenter.com with purchase code

### What happens if my backend is down?

**Mobile app shows error messages** and can't function until backend is back online.

**Prevent downtime:**
- Choose reliable hosting (99.9%+ uptime SLAs)
- Set up automatic backups (most hosts include this)
- Use monitoring service (free): UptimeRobot.com
- Keep WordPress & plugin updated

**Most shared hosting providers** have 99.9% uptime = less than 9 hours downtime per year.

### Is the plugin compatible with my WordPress theme?

**Yes!** The API plugin is backend-only and works with ANY WordPress theme.

**Compatible with:**
- ✅ Any WordPress theme (default themes, premium themes, custom themes)
- ✅ Page builders (Elementor, WPBakery, Divi, etc.)
- ✅ WooCommerce (if you want e-commerce features)
- ✅ Multilingual plugins (WPML, Polylang)

The API plugin provides REST endpoints. It doesn't affect your WordPress frontend/theme at all.
